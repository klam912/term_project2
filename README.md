# Term project part 2
This repo contains folders each demonstrating a unique/interesting feature of Go.

## Getting started
Clone the git repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/klam912/term_project2.git
cd term_project2
```

## Run any of the `.go` files in each folder
Select a folder to examine a feature of Go:
```bash
cd folder-name
```

If there's already a `go.mod` file, do not run `go mod init` again. 
If not, run:
```bash
go mod init term_project2/folder-name
```

Once you have the `go.mod` file, run the file:
```bash
go run file-name.go
```
